    <h2>What is C++?</h2>
    <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the <a href="/c/index.php">C language</a>.</p>
    <p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
    <p>The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</p>

    <h2>Why Use C++</h2>
    <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</p>
    <p>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</p>
    <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs.</p>
    <p>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</p>
    <p>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>
    <p>As C++ is close to <a href="/c/index.php">C</a>, <a href="/cs/index.php">C#</a> and <a
            href="/java/default.asp">Java</a>, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.</p>

    <h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>
    <p>C++ was developed as an extension of <a href="/c/index.php">C</a>, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
    </p>
    <p>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>
